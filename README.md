# Project Title
Regret — an indie horror demo game developed in Unreal Engine 5.

## Introduction / Relevance
Regret is a short, atmospheric horror game created to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of Unreal Engine 5 and the Blueprint visual scripting system, with the intention to transition to C++ in the future.

## Project Goal and Objectives
### Goal: To create an interactive demo game with psychological horror elements and dialogue, focusing on atmosphere, sound, and visual style.

### Objectives:

1. Learn and apply Unreal Engine 5 and Blueprint skills.

2. Implement basic mechanics such as movement, interaction, and scripted events.

3. Create a sense of fear using lighting, sound, and level design.

4. Use free Fab assets for prototyping and mapping.

## Target Audience
1. Fans of indie horror and short narrative-driven games.

2. Developers learning Unreal Engine.

3. The gamedev community interested in Blueprint-based projects.

## Project Description
### Genre: Psychological indie horror.

### Perspective: First-person.

The player explores locations and interacts with NPCs through dialogues that reflect themes of regret and loss.

### Implemented via Blueprints:

1. Interaction logic (e.g. doors, items).

2. Event triggers (scare moments, sounds).

3. Lighting systems and post-processing.

4. NPC behavior and dialogue.

> Visual and audio effects enhance the tension and overall atmosphere.

## Development Plan / Timeline
1. Concept planning and asset selection (**ongoing throughout the project**).

2. Base level design and navigation setup (**2 days**).

3. Implementation of core game mechanics (**1 month**).

4. Sound and visual effects integration (**1.5 months — WIP**).

5. Scene testing and polishing (**WIP**).

6. Final adjustments and packaging (**WIP**).

## Resources
### Technical:
PC with ray tracing support, Unreal Engine 5.

### Content: 
Free assets from the Fab marketplace (models, sounds, materials).

### Development Tools: 
Blueprints, built-in Level Editor, Sequencer, AI tools, YouTube video guides.

## Expected Results
A 10–30 minute playable demo with a carefully crafted horror atmosphere.

A demonstration of essential skills in UE5 and visual scripting.

**A foundation for a future full game or a strong portfolio piece.**

## Risks and Challenges
1. Limited availability and suitability of free assets.

2. Blueprint limitations compared to pure C++ (can be overcome with experience).

3. Limited time for optimization and thorough testing.

## Conclusion
**Regret is a personal, experimental project that blends learning, creativity, and hands-on practice within Unreal Engine 5. It lays the groundwork for larger future projects and showcases the potential of visual scripting to create emotionally engaging and expressive game scenes.**
